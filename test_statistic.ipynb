    "To determine whether the group from the Honolulu Heart Study is significantly different from the regular population with respect to systolic blood pressure, we can perform a **one-sample t-test**. Here's how we can set up and conduct the hypothesis test:\n",

    "**1) Arrange the Hypothesis Test**\n",
    "- _Null Hypothesis_ $(H_0)$: The mean systolic blood pressure of the group is equal to the population mean. \n",
    "    - $H_0:\\mu=120$\n",

    "    - $H_1:\\mu\\ne120$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a _two-tailed test_ because we are testing for a difference, not just an increase or decrease.\n",

    "- We assume a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$. In other words, we are willing to accept a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. \n",

    "**3) Calculate the Test Statistic**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The formula for the _t-statistic_ in a one-sample t-test is:\n",
